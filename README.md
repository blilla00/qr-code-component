## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using Semantic HTML tags to make pages more accessible
- Never set width: 100vw as this can cause horizontal scroll
- Instead of explicitly setting component height and width, use max-width property with rem units
- Applied Andy Bell's Modern CSS Reset
- Border radius values are better supplied in rem rather than percentages
- Using percentages are typically bad practice and should be avoided when possible. 

### Continued development

- Need to further my layout skills and associated layout technologies (normal flow, flex, grid)
- Need more experience manipulating images
- Typography skills
- Responsive layouts
